# How do I use a .gar file in Ghidra?
First make sure you have no current projects open, you can do this by going to `File > Close Project`

Then once you confirm there is no active project, go to `File > Restore Project`

Upon clicking Restore Project a menu should pop up called `Restore Project Archive`

Click the three dots next to the `Archive File` slot, and select the `.gar` file.

(Optional) Change the `Restore Directory` or `Project Name`.

Once you've finished that press ok, it should do some extracting and congrats you have an analyzed BDS.
